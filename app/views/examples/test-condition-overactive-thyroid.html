    <p class="nhsuk-body-l">An overactive thyroid, also known as hyperthyroidism, is where the thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones.</strong></p>
    <p>The thyroid is found at the front of the neck. It produces hormones that affect things such as your heart rate and body temperature.</p>
    <p>Extra levels of&nbsp;these&nbsp;hormones can cause unpleasant and potentially serious problems that&nbsp;may require treatment.</p>
    <p>An overactive thyroid&nbsp;can affect anyone, but it's about 10 times more common in women than men and it typically starts&nbsp;between 20 and 40 years of age.</p>
    <h2 id="symptoms-of-an-overactive-thyroid">Symptoms&nbsp;of an overactive thyroid</h2>
    <p>An overactive thyroid can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>nervousness, anxiety and irritability </li>
      <li>mood swings </li>
      <li><a href="/conditions/Insomnia/Pages/Introduction.aspx">difficulty sleeping</a></li>
      <li>persistent tiredness and weakness </li>
      <li>sensitivity to heat </li>

    <h2 id="when-to-see-your-gp">When&nbsp;to see your GP</h2>
    <p>See your GP if you have symptoms of an overactive thyroid.</p>
    <p>They will ask about&nbsp;your symptoms and can arrange a blood test to check how well your thyroid is working if they think you might have a thyroid problem.</p>
    <p>If the blood test shows that you have an overactive thyroid, you may be referred for further tests to identify the cause.</p>

    <h2 id="treatments-for-an-overactive-thyroid">Treatments&nbsp;for an overactive thyroid</h2>
    <p>An overactive thyroid&nbsp;is&nbsp;usually treatable.</p>
    <p>The main treatments are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>medication that stops&nbsp;your thyroid producing too much of the thyroid hormones </li>
      <li>radioiodine treatment –&nbsp;where radiation is used to damage&nbsp;your thyroid, reducing its ability to produce thyroid hormones </li>
      <li>surgery&nbsp;to remove some or all of your&nbsp;thyroid, so that it no longer produces thyroid hormones </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these treatments has benefits and drawbacks. You'll normally see an endocrinologist (specialist in hormone conditions) to discuss which is best for you.</p>

    <h2 id="causes-of-an-overactive-thyroid">Causes&nbsp;of an overactive thyroid</h2>
    <p>There are a number of reasons why the thyroid can become overactive.</p>
    <p>These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Graves' disease&nbsp;– where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and damages the thyroid </li>
      <li>lumps (nodules) on the thyroid&nbsp;– this results in extra thyroid tissue, which&nbsp;can mean extra thyroid hormones are produced </li>
      <li>certain medications&nbsp;– such as&nbsp;amiodarone, a medication for an&nbsp;<a href="/Conditions/arrhythmia/Pages/arrhythmia.aspx">irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>About three in every four cases are&nbsp;because of&nbsp;Graves' disease.</p>

    <h2 id="further-problems">Further&nbsp;problems</h2>
    <p>An overactive thyroid, particularly if it's not treated or well controlled, can sometimes lead to further problems.</p>
    <p>These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>eye problems&nbsp;– such as eye irritation,&nbsp;<a href="/conditions/Double-vision/Pages/Introduction.aspx">double vision</a> or&nbsp;<a href="/Conditions/Exophthalmos/Pages/Introduction.aspx">bulging eyes</a></li>
      <li>pregnancy complications&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a href="/Conditions/Pre-eclampsia/Pages/Complications.aspx">pre-eclampsia</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/premature-early-labour.aspx">premature birth</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="/conditions/Miscarriage/Pages/Introduction.aspx">miscarriage</a></li>
