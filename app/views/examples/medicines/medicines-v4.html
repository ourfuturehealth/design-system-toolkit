									<div class="block-section_text"><div class="rich-text"><p>Paracetamol is a common painkiller for children. It's used to treat most kinds of childhood ailments, including <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/symptoms/headache">headache</a>, <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stomach-ache-abdominal-pain/pages/introduction.aspx">tummy ache</a>, <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/earache/Pages/Introduction.aspx">earache</a>, and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Cold-common/Pages/Introduction.aspx">cold symptoms</a>. It can also be used to reduce <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/feverchildren/Pages/Introduction.aspx">fever</a> (38C or above).</p>
								<p>For older children, paracetamol is available as tablets.</p>
								<p>For young children, paracetamol comes as a syrup.</p>
								<p>Paracetamol is also available as suppositories (a plug of medicine that's inserted into the back passage). Suppositories are useful to relieve pain and fever in children who find it difficult to swallow tablets or syrup, or who are vomiting a lot.</p>

												<li>Your child should start to feel better about 30 minutes after taking paracetamol tablets or syrup. It may take up to an hour for a suppository to work properly.</li>

												<li>Don't give your child paracetamol with other medicines containing paracetamol, such as Lemsip or Night Nurse (only suitable for children over 12 years).</li>
												<li>Paracetamol is an everyday medicine, but it can be dangerous if too much is taken. Be careful to keep it out of the reach of children.</li>

												<h3>How often to give paracetamol</h3>
												<p>If your child needs help with pain day and night for several days, give a dose of paracetamol every 6 hours. Don't give more than 4 doses in 24 hours. This will help to relieve the pain safely without the risk of giving too much paracetamol.</p>

												<div class="block-section_text"><div class="rich-text"><h3>How to give paracetamol to a child</h3>
												<h4>Tablets</h4>
												<p>Tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, milk, or juice. Tell your child not to chew the tablet.</p>
												<p>Calpol Fastmelts shouldn't be swallowed - ask your child to let them dissolve on their tongue.</p>
												<h4>Syrup</h4>
												<p>Shake the bottle well for at least 10 seconds and measure out the right amount using the plastic syringe or spoon that comes with the medicine. If you don't have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Don't use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount.</p>
												<p>To hide the taste of liquid medicine, you can give the child a drink of milk or fruit juice straight after giving the medicine.</p>
												<h4>Suppositories</h4>
												<p>Paracetamol suppositories are small plugs of medicine that are inserted into the bottom. Follow the instructions on the leaflet inside the packet.</p>
												<h3>What if they take too much?</h3>
												<p>Giving your child too much paracetamol by accident can be dangerous. The effects of an overdose may not be obvious, but they can be serious and need treatment.</p>
												<p>If you think you may have given your child an extra dose of paracetamol by mistake, wait at least 24 hours before giving them any more.</p></div></div>

													<p>Do not give paracetamol and ibuprofen together, though. Instead, if you've given them paracetamol and they're still feverish or in pain when the next dose is due, you could try ibuprofen instead.</p>
													<p>Don't take more than the maximum daily dose of either medicine. See your doctor if you've tried both paracetamol and ibuprofen and they haven't helped. Do not give ibuprofen to your child if they have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/pages/introduction.aspx">asthma</a>, unless your doctor has said it's ok.</p>
													<p>Don't give your child another medicine with paracetamol in it. If they take 2 different medicines that contain paracetamol, there's a risk of overdose. Paracetamol is an ingredient in lots of medicines that you can buy from the supermarket or pharmacy, such as Lemsip, Day and Night Nurse capsules or liquid (only suitable for children over 12 years).</p>
													<p>Never give aspirin to a child under the age of 16 (unless prescribed by a doctor).</p></div></div>
