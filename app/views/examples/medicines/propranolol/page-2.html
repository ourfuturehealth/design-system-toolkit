      <p>Propranolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta blockers. It's used to treat heart problems, help with <a href="https://content-platform.service.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/understanding-panic/">anxiety</a> and prevent <a href="https://content-platform.service.nhs.uk/conditions/migraine/">migraines</a>.</p>
      <p>If you have a heart problem, you can take propranolol to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>treat <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Blood-pressure-(high)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">high blood pressure</a></li>
        <li>treat illnesses that cause an <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/arrhythmia/">irregular heartbeat</a>, like <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/atrial-fibrillation/">atrial fibrillation</a></li>
        <li>prevent future heart disease, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/Pages/Introduction.aspx">heart attacks</a> and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Stroke/Pages/Introduction.aspx">strokes</a></li>
        <li>prevent chest pain caused by <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/Pages/Introduction.aspx">angina</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Propranolol can help reduce your symptoms if you have too much thyroid hormone in your body (thyrotoxicosis). You'll usually take it together with medicines to treat an <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/overactive-thyroid-hyperthyroidism/">overactive thyroid</a>.</p>
      <p>This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets, capsules, or as a liquid to swallow.</p>

          <div class="c-common-questions__content" id="question-1" aria-hidden="true">
            <p>Propranolol is a type of medicine called a beta blocker.</p>
            <p>Like other beta blockers, propranolol works by changing the way your body responds to some nerve impulses, including in the heart. It slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.</p>
            <p>It works differently if you're using it for anxiety. When you are anxious, your brain makes chemical messengers called adrenaline and noradrenaline. These make your heart rate faster and make you sweat or shake. Propranolol helps block the effects of these chemical messengers. This reduces the physical signs of anxiety.</p>

          <div class="c-common-questions__content" id="question-6" aria-hidden="true">
            <p>Propranolol works as well as other beta blockers for reducing blood pressure. The main difference between propranolol and other beta blockers is that it doesn't just affect your heart. It can affect other parts of your body too, such as your lungs.</p>
            <p>There are lots of other medicines to lower your blood pressure and treat chest pain. They work in a different way to beta blockers and include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ACE inhibitors - for example <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/ramipril/">ramipril</a> and <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/lisinopril/">lisinopril</a></li>
              <li>angiotensin receptor blockers - for example <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/candesartan/">candesartan</a></li>
              <li>calcium channel blockers - for example <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/amlodipine/">amlodipine</a></li>
              <li>diuretics (medicines which make you pee more) - for example <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/furosemide/">furosemide</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beta blockers aren't usually the first choice treatment for <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Blood-pressure-(high)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">high blood pressure</a>. The medicine your doctor prescribes depends on your age and ethnicity.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If you're under 55, you'll usually be offered an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.</li>
              <li>If you're 55 or older, or you're any age and of African Caribbean or black African origin, you'll usually be offered a calcium channel blocker.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sometimes you may have to try other blood pressure-lowering medicines if you get side effects. Many people need to take a combination of different blood pressure-lowering tablets.</p>

            <p>There are some other medicines that are known to prevent migraines but they are not officially approved in the UK. They include amitriptyline, sodium valproate and <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/gabapentin">gabapentin</a> and they may have different side effects.</p>

            <p>Propranolol treats the physical symptoms of anxiety - for example, it stops your heart beating too fast. You'll usually only take propranolol for a short time.</p>
            <p>The physical symptoms of anxiety are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. Your doctor may prescribe an antidepressant like <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/sertraline/">sertraline</a> to treat these imbalances. You usually take antidepressants long term.</p>
            <p>Many doctors prefer drug-free treatments. These include talking therapies like <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/">cognitive behavioural therapy</a>. If you're having talking therapy, your doctor may prescribe propranolol at the same time. This will help you with your physical symptoms.</p>

      <p>Propranolol comes as 2 different types of medicine: standard release and slow release.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard release - releases propranolol into your body quickly. You may need to take it several times a day depending on your dose.</li>
        <li>Slow release - dissolves slowly so you don't have to take it as often. Once a day is usually enough.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are taking it once a day, your doctor may advise you to take your first dose before bedtime, because it can make you feel dizzy. After the first dose, if you don’t feel dizzy, take propranolol in the morning.</p>

      <div class="nhsuk-c-callout__warning-v5">
        <p>Keep taking propranolol even if you feel well. You will still be getting the benefits of the medicine.</p>

      </div>

      <h3>How much to take</h3>
      <p>How much you take depends on why you need propranolol.</p>
      <p>Doses for adults and children over the age of 12:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>For high blood pressure</strong>, the starting dose is usually 80mg twice a day. If this dose isn't working well enough (if your blood pressure doesn't go down enough), your doctor may increase it to a maximum of 160mg twice a day.</li>
        <li><strong>For angina (chest pain) or migraine</strong>, the usual dose is 40mg taken 2 or 3 times a day. This can be increased to 120mg to 240mg a day. Your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to split the dose over the day.</li>
        <li><strong>For irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)</strong>, the usual dose is 10mg to 40mg 3 or 4 times a day.</li>
        <li><strong>For anxiety</strong>, the usual dose is 40mg once a day which can be increased to 40mg 3 times a day.</li>
        <li><strong>For too much thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis)</strong>, the dose is 10mg to 40mg taken 3 or 4 times a day.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Doses are usually lower for the elderly or people with a kidney or liver problem.</p>
      <p>If your child is under 12 years old and they need propranolol, your doctor will usually use your child's weight to work out the right dose.</p>
      <h3>How to take it</h3>
      <p>Propranolol doesn't usually upset your tummy so you can take it with or without food. It's best to do the same each day.</p>
      <p>Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. If you find them difficult to swallow, some brands have a score line to help you break the tablet in half. Check the information leaflet for your brand to see if you can do this.</p>
      <p>If you're taking propranolol as a liquid, it will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you don't have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Don't use a kitchen teaspoon as it won't give you the right amount of medicine.</p>

            <p>You can boost the health of your heart by making some key lifestyle changes. These will also help if you get migraines, or you feel stressed or anxious.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/smoking/Pages/Gethelp.aspx">Stop smoking</a> - smoking increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Quitting smoking brings down your blood pressure and relieves heart failure symptoms. Try to avoid secondhand smoke.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/Alcoholhome.aspx">Drink alcohol sensibly</a> - drinking alcohol while you're taking propranolol can make you feel dizzy or light headed. Also drinking too much alcohol raises blood pressure over time and makes heart failure worse. Men and women shouldn't drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week. A standard glass of wine (175ml)  is 2 units. A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/fitness/Pages/Fitnesshome.aspx">Be more active</a> - regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. It doesn't need to be too energetic - walking every day will help.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/healthy-eating/Pages/Healthyeating.aspx">Eat healthily</a> - aim to eat a diet that includes plenty of fruit and veg, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products and lean proteins. It's a good idea to <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/cut-down-salt.aspx">cut down on salt</a> too. Eating too much salt is the biggest cause of high blood pressure - the more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be. Aim for no more than 6g of salt a day.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/understanding-stress.aspx">Manage stress</a> - when you're anxious or upset, your heart beats faster, you breathe more heavily and your blood pressure often goes up. This can make heart failure worse too. Find ways to reduce stress in your life. To give your heart a rest, try napping or putting your feet up when possible. Spend time with friends and family to be social and help avoid stress.</li>

      <h3>If you forget to take it</h3>
      <p>If you forget to take a dose of propranolol, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as normal.</p>
      <p>Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
      <p>If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p>
      <h3>If you take too much</h3>
      <p>An overdose of propranolol can slow down your heart rate and make it difficult to breathe. It can also cause dizziness and trembling.</p>
      <p>The amount of propranolol that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.</p>

      <div class="nhsuk-c-callout__warning-v5">
        <p>If you take too much propranolol by accident, call your doctor or go to your <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/service-search/Accident-and-emergency-services/LocationSearch/428">nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department</a> straight away.</p>
      </div>
      <p>If you need to go to hospital, don't drive yourself - get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance. Take the propranolol packet or leaflet inside it plus any remaining medicine with you.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>shortness of breath with a cough which gets worse when you exercise (like walking up stairs), swollen ankles or legs, chest pain, or an irregular heartbeat - these are signs of heart problems</li>

      <h3>What to do about:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>feeling tired, dizzy or light headed</strong> - as your body gets used to propranolol, these side effects should wear off. If propranolol makes you feel dizzy, sit or lie down until you feel better. Try to avoid alcohol as it will make you feel worse.</li>
        <li><strong>cold hands or feet</strong> - put your hands or feet under warm running water, massage them and wiggle your fingers and toes. Don't smoke or have drinks with caffeine in - these can make your blood vessels narrower and restrict your blood flow. Smoking also makes your skin colder. Try wearing mittens (they're warmer than gloves) and warm socks. Don't wear tight watches or bracelets.</li>
        <li><strong>difficulties sleeping or nightmares</strong> - try taking your propranolol in the morning. If you have to take it more than once a day, speak to your doctor. They may be able to change your propranolol to the slow release form.</li>
        <li><strong>feeling sick</strong> - stick to simple meals and don't eat rich or spicy food. It might help to take your propranolol after a meal or snack.</li>

So if you’re trying to get pregnant or you’re already pregnant, talk to your doctor about the benefits and possible harms of taking propranolol. There may be other medicines that are safer for you.</p>
      <h3>Propranolol and breastfeeding</h3>
      <p>It is usually safe to take propranolol if you’re breastfeeding. This is because only small amounts get into breast milk, which is not enough to cause any problems to your baby.</p>
