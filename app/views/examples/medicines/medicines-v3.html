											<p>Candesartan is a medicine widely used to treat <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Blood-pressure-(high)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">high blood pressure</a> and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Heart-failure/Pages/Introduction.aspx">heart failure</a>.</p>
											<p>Candesartan helps to prevent future <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Stroke/Pages/Introduction.aspx">strokes</a>, <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Heart-attack/Pages/Introduction.aspx">heart attacks</a> and kidney problems.

							<li>Candesartan lowers your blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.</li>
							<li>It’s often used as a second-choice treatment if you had to stop taking your first because it gave you a dry, irritating cough.</li>
							<li>The main side effects of candesartan are dizziness, headache and 
							cold or flu-like symptoms - but they’re usually mild and short-lived.</li>
							<li>Drinking alcohol can increase the blood pressure-lowering effect of candesartan, which can make you feel dizzy or light-headed.</li>
							<li>Candesartan is also called by the brand name Amias.</li></ul></div></div>

									<h2 class="o-section__header above" id="how-and-when-to-take-it">How and when to take it</h2>
									<div class="block-section_text"><div class="rich-text"><p>It’s usual to take candesartan tablets once a day. You can take your 
							daily candesartan tablet at any time of day, but try to be consistent 
							and take it at the same time every day.</p>
							<p>You can take candesartan tablets with or without food. Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water.</p>
							<h3 class="above"><strong>How much will I take?</strong></h3>
							<p>The dose of candesartan you take depends on why you need the medicine. Take it as instructed by your doctor.</p>
							<p>As a general rule in adults, the dose to treat:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>high blood pressure is 8mg to 32mg once a day</li>
							<li>heart failure is 4mg to 32mg once a day</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In people with liver or kidney problems, the dose may be lower.</p>
							<p>As a general rule in children (aged 6 years and over), the dose to treat high blood pressure is:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>for children weighing less than 50kg, the dose is 4mg to 8mg once a day</li>
							<li>for children weighing 50kg and more, the dose is 4mg to 16mg once daily</li>
							</ul>
							<h3 class="above"><strong>Will my dose go up or down?</strong></h3>
							<p>You will start on a low dose of candesartan. After a few weeks your 
							doctor will check your blood pressure and ask you if you’re getting any 
							side effects. You may also have blood tests to check how well your 
							kidneys are working and the amount of potassium in your blood. Your 
							doctor will then decide whether to change your dose of candesartan.</p>
							<p>If candesartan doesn’t get your blood pressure down, your doctor may 
							want to increase the dose. If your blood pressure gets too low or you 
							get side effects, your doctor may want to lower your candesartan dose.</p></div></div>
							<div class="block-alert_callout">
							
							
							<div class="c-callout__alert">
									<div class="rich-text"><p>Take candesartan even if you feel well, as you will still be getting the benefits of the medicine.</p></div>

							</div>
							<div class="block-section_text"><div class="rich-text"><h3 class="above">What if I forget to take it?</h3>
							<p>If you miss a dose of candesartan, take it as soon as you remember. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
							<p>If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways that are suitable for you and your medicines.</p>
							<h3 class="above">What if I take too much?</h3>
							<p>If you take too many candesartan tablets by accident, contact your doctor or nearest hospital straight away. An overdose of candesartan can cause low blood pressure and dizziness.</p>
							<p>The amount of candesartan that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.</p></div></div>

									<div class="block-section_text"><div class="rich-text"><p>Like all medicines, candesartan can cause side effects although not everyone gets them. Side effects often improve as your body gets used to the medicine.</p>
							<h3 class="above"><strong>Common side effects</strong></h3>
							<p>These common side effects happen in more than 1 in 100 people.</p>
							<p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects bother you or don’t go away:</p>

							<p>It happens rarely, but some people have serious side effects after taking candesartan.</p>
							<p>Tell a doctor straight away if you have:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>yellow skin or eyes - this can be a sign of liver problems</li>
							<li>pale skin, feeling tired, faint or dizzy, purple spots, any sign of bleeding, sore throat and fever - these can be signs of blood or bone marrow disorder</li>
							<li>weakness, an irregular heartbeat, pins and needles and muscle cramps - these can be signs of changes in the sodium and potassium levels in your blood</li>

							<ul>
							<li><strong>feeling dizzy</strong> - if candesartan makes you feel dizzy when you stand up, try getting up very slowly or stay sitting down until you feel better. If you begin to feel dizzy, lie down so that you don't faint, then sit until you feel better. Don’t drive or use tools or machines if you feel dizzy, have muscle cramps or muscle pain, or if 
							you just feel a bit shaky.</li>
							<li><strong>feeling sick</strong> - try taking your tablets with or after a meal or snack. It may also help if you don’t eat rich or spicy food.</li>
							<li><strong>headaches</strong> - make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Don’t drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Headaches should usually go away after the first week of taking candesartan. Talk to your doctor if they last longer than a week or are severe.</li>
							<li><strong>vomiting or diarrhoea </strong>- drink plenty of water to prevent <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx">dehydration</a>. If you’re vomiting try small, frequent sips. It may also help to take oral rehydration solutions to prevent dehydration. You can buy these from a pharmacy or supermarket. If you get severe vomiting or diarrhoea from a stomach bug or illness, tell your doctor. You may need to stop taking candesartan for a while until you feel better.</li>
							<li><strong>pain in your joints or muscles</strong> - if you get unusual muscle pain, weakness or tiredness which isn't from exercise or hard work, talk to your doctor. You may need a blood test to check what might be causing it.</li></ul></div></div>

																		<p>During the first few days of taking candesartan or after a dose increase, it is best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine affects you.</p>

                                <p>Don't use salt substitutes such as Lo-Salt. This is because they are high in potassium. When mixed with candesartan they may make the level of potassium in your blood too high.
																		
																		Other than alcohol, there's nothing else you need to avoid while taking candesartan. Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help if you have high blood pressure or heart failure.</p>

																<p>There are several other angiotensin receptor blocker medicines which work in the same way as candesartan. They include <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/irbesartan/">irbesartan</a>, <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/losartan/">losartan</a> and <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/valsartan/">valsartan</a>.</p>

																<p>There are also other types of blood pressure-lowering medicines such as:</p>

																<ul>
																		<li> ACE inhibitors - for example <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/ramipril/">ramipril</a></li>
																		<li> calcium-channel blockers - for example <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/amlodipine/">amlodipine</a></li>
																		<li> beta-blockers - for example bisoprolol</li>
																		<li> diuretics (water tablets) - for example bendroflumethiazide</li>
																		</ul>

																		<p>The blood pressure-lowering medicine you’re prescribed depends on your age and ethnicity:</p>

																		<ul>
																				<li> if you're under 55 - you'll usually be offered an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker</li>
																				<li> if you're 55 or older, or you're any age and of African or Caribbean origin - you'll usually be offered a calcium channel blocker</li>
																				</ul>

																				<p>Many people need to take a combination of different blood pressure-lowering medicines.</p>
