		<ul>
			<li>have had an allergic reaction to amoxicillin or penicillin or any other medicines&nbsp;in the past</li>

		<h2 class="o-section__header" id="how-when">4. How and when to take it</h2>
		<p>The usual dose of amoxicillin is 250mg to 500mg taken 3 times a day. The dose may be lower for children.</p>
		<p>Try to space the doses evenly throughout the day. If you take it 3 times a day, this could be first thing in the morning, mid-afternoon, and at bedtime.</p>
		<p>You can take amoxicillin before or after food.</p>
		
		
		<div class="nhsuk-c-callout__warning-v4" role="alert">
			<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Important</h3>
			<p>Carry on taking this medicine until you've completed the course, even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early, the infection could come back.</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>How to take it</h3>
		<p>Swallow amoxicillin capsules whole with a drink of water. Don't chew or break them.</p>
		<p>Amoxicillin is available as a liquid for children and people who find it difficult to swallow tablets.</p>
		<p>If you or your child are taking amoxicillin as a liquid, it will usually be made up for you by your pharmacist. The medicine will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out&nbsp;the right dose. If you don't have one, ask your pharmacist for one.</p>
		
		<h3><strong>What if I forget to take it?</strong></h3>
		<p>If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as normal.</p>
		<p>Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
		<p>If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember your medicines.</p>
		
		<h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
		<p>Accidentally taking an extra dose of amoxicillin is unlikely to harm you or your child.</p>
		<p>Speak to your pharmacist or doctor if you're worried or you take more than&nbsp;1 extra dose.</p>
