						<p>Treatment depends on the type of AMD you have.</p>

						<ul>
						<li><strong>Dry AMD</strong> – there's no treatment, but vision aids can help reduce the effect on your life. Read about <a href="/conditions/age-related-macular-degeneration-amd/living-with-amd/">living with AMD</a>.</li>
						<li><strong>Wet AMD</strong> – you may need regular eye injections and, very occasionally, a light treatment called "photodynamic therapy" to stop your vision getting worse.</li>

						<h3>Eye injections</h3>
						<p><strong>Anti-VEGF medicines – ranibizumab (Lucentis) and aflibercept (Eylea)</strong></p>
						<p>Injections given directly into the eyes.</p>
						<ul>
						<li>stops vision getting worse in 9 out of 10 people and improves vision in 3 out of 10 people</li>
						<li>usually given every 1 or 2 months for as long as necessary</li>
						<li>drops numb the eyes before treatment – most people have minimal discomfort</li>
						<li>side effects include bleeding in the eye, feeling like there's something in the eye, and eyes being red and irritated</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The Macular Society has more on <a href="https://www.macularsociety.org/diagnosis-and-treatment" title="External website">injections for wet AMD</a>.</p>
								

						<h3>Light treatment</h3>
						<p><strong>Photodynamic therapy (PDT)</strong></p>
						<p>A light is shined at the back of the eyes to destroy the abnormal blood vessels that cause wet AMD.</p>
						<ul>
						<li>may be recommended alongside eye injections if injections alone don't help</li>
						<li>usually needs to be repeated every few months</li>
						<li>side effects include temporary vision problems, and the eyes and skin being sensitive to light for a few days or weeks</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Research into new treatments</h2>
						
						<p>Research into new treatments for AMD is ongoing. Your specialist can let you know if there are any studies you could take part in.</p>
						
						<p>You can also <a href="https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/home/" title="External website">search the UK Clinical Trials Gateway (UKCTG)</a> to find studies.</p>
