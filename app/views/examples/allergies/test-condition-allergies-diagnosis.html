			<p>Your GP can offer advice and treatment for mild allergies with a clear cause.</p>

			<p>If your allergy is more severe or it's not obvious what you're allergic to, you may be referred for allergy testing at a specialist allergy clinic.</p>

      {{ actionLink("http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Allergies/LocationSearch/220", "Find your nearest NHS allergy clinic") }}

			<p>The tests that may be carried out are described on this page.</p>

						{{ image("Picture of a skin prick test", "https://assets.nhs.uk/prod/images/M3200456.2e16d0ba.fill-920x613.jpg", "<p>Skin prick testing is one of the most common allergy tests.</p>") }}

			<p>Skin prick testing is one of the most common allergy tests.</p>

			<p>It involves putting a drop of liquid onto your forearm that contains a substance you may be allergic to. The skin under the drop is then gently pricked with a needle. If you are allergic to the substance, an itchy, red bump will appear within 15 minutes.</p>

			<p>Skin prick testing is painless and very safe.</p>

			{{ keypoint("<p>Make sure you don't take <a href='http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antihistamines/Pages/Introduction.aspx'>antihistamines</a> before the test, as they can interfere with the results.</p>") }}

			<h2 id="blood-tests">Blood tests</h2>

			<p><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-tests/pages/introduction.aspx">Blood tests</a> may be used instead of, or alongside, skin prick tests to help diagnose common allergies.</p>

			<p>A sample of your blood is removed and analysed for specific antibodies produced by your immune system in response to an allergen.</p>

			<h2 id="patch-tests">Patch tests</h2>

			<p>Patch tests are used to investigate a type of eczema known as <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/eczema-%28contact-dermatitis%29/Pages/Introduction.aspx">contact dermatitis</a>, which can be caused by your skin being exposed to an allergen.</p>

			<p>A small amount of the suspected allergen is added to special metal discs, which are then taped to your skin for 48 hours and monitored for a reaction.</p>

			<h2 id="elimination-diet">Elimination diet</h2>

			<p>If you have a suspected <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/food-allergy/Pages/Intro1.aspx">food allergy</a>, you may be advised to avoid eating a particular food to see if your symptoms improve. </p>

			<p>After a few weeks, you may then be asked to eat the food again to check if you have another reaction.</p>

			<p>Don't attempt to do this yourself without discussing it with a qualified healthcare professional.</p>

			<h2 id="challenge-testing">Challenge testing</h2>

			<p>In a few cases, a test called a food challenge may also be used to diagnose a food allergy. </p>

			<p>During the test, you're given the food you think you're allergic to in gradually increasing amounts, to see how you react under close supervision.</p>

			<p>This test is riskier than other forms of testing, as it could cause a severe reaction, but is the most accurate way to diagnose food allergies. And challenge testing is always carried out in a clinic where a severe reaction can be treated if it does develop.</p>

			<h2 id="allergy-testing-kits">Allergy testing kits</h2>

			<p>The use of commercial allergy-testing kits isn't recommended. These tests are often of a lower standard than those provided by the NHS or accredited private clinics and are generally considered to be unreliable.</p>

			<p>Allergy tests should be interpreted by a qualified professional who has detailed knowledge of your symptoms and medical history.</p>
