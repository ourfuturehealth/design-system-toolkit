<h2 id="symptoms">Check if it's a slipped disc</h2>

<p>A slipped disc (also called a prolapsed or herniated disc) can cause:</p>
<ul>
	<li>lower back pain</li>
	<li>numbness or tingling in your shoulders, back, arms, hands, legs or feet</li>
	<li>neck pain</li>
	<li>problems bending or straightening your back</li>
	<li>muscle weakness</li>
	<li>pain in the buttocks, hips or legs if the disc is <a href="/conditions/sciatica/">pressing on the sciatic nerve (sciatica)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Not all slipped discs cause symptoms. Many people will never know they have slipped a disc.</p>


<h3>Other causes of back pain</h3>

<p>Sometimes the pain may be a result of an injury such as a <a href="/conditions/sprains-and-strains">sprain or strain</a> but often there's no obvious reason.</p>
<p><a href="/conditions/back-pain/">Back pain</a> is rarely caused by anything serious.</p>

<h2 id="things-you-can-try">How you can ease the pain yourself</h2>

<h3>Keep active</h3>

<p>If the pain is very bad, you may need to rest at first. But start gentle exercise as soon as you can – it will help you get better faster.</p>
<p>The type of exercise isn't important, just gradually increase your activity level.</p>


<h3>Take painkillers</h3>

<p>Alternate painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol. Paracetamol on its own isn't recommended for back pain.</p>
<p>Take them regularly (up to the recommended daily amount) rather than just when the pain is particularly bad. This will help you to keep moving.</p>


<h2 id="how-a-pharmacist-can-help">A pharmacist can help with a slipped disc</h2>

<p><a href="/conditions/nsaids">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</a> like ibuprofen aren't suitable for everyone. Speak to a pharmacist if you're not sure.</p>
<p>Stronger painkillers containing codeine may help for pain that has just started. But these types of painkillers can cause addiction and should only be used for a few days.</p>

<h3>What happens at your appointment</h3>

<p>Your GP will usually be able to tell if you have a slipped disc from your symptoms.</p>
<p>You may also have a physical examination. Your GP might ask you to raise your arms or do simple leg exercises to find out where the slipped disc is.</p>


<h2 id="treatment-from-a-gp">Treatment from a GP</h2>

<p>Your GP might prescribe a stronger painkiller, a steroid injection or a muscle relaxant to use in the short term.</p>
<p>If your symptoms don't get better your GP might recommend further tests, like an MRI scan.</p>
<p>They might also refer you to a physiotherapist. Physiotherapy from the NHS might not be available everywhere and waiting times can be long. You can also get it privately.</p>

{{ actionLink("http://www.csp.org.uk/your-health/find-physio/physio2u", "Find a physiotherapist") }}

<h2 id="surgery">Surgery for a slipped disc</h2>

<p>Surgery isn't usually needed but your GP might refer to you a specialist to discuss surgery if your symptoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>haven't improved using other treatments</li>
<li>include worsening muscle weakness, or numbness</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alternative-treatments">Alternative treatments for slipped disc</h2>

<p>There's some evidence that <a href="/conditions/physiotherapy/how-it-works/#manual-therapy">manual therapies</a> like osteopathy can help ease lower back pain.</p>

<p>You'll usually have to pay for this treatment privately.</p>

<h2 id="causes">What causes slipped disc</h2>

<p>They can happen because of:</p>

<ul>
<li>ageing</li>
<li>exercising too hard</li>
<li>lifting heavy objects the wrong way</li>
<li>vibration – from driving or operating machinery</li>
<li>being inactive or overweight</li>
</ul>
