        <h2>How to ease knee pain and swelling</h2>

        <p>Try these things at first:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>put as little weight as possible on the knee – for example, avoid standing for a long time</li>
        <li>use an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas wrapped in a teatowel) on your knee for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours</li>
        <li>take paracetamol</li>
        </ul>
