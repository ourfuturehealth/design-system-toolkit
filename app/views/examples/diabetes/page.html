			<p>The best way to keep your symptoms under control is often to avoid the things you're allergic to, although this isn't always practical.</p>

			<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/food-allergy/Pages/Intro1.aspx">food allergies</a> by being careful about what you eat </li>
			<li>animal allergies by keeping pets outside as much as possible and washing them regularly </li>

			<li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Hay-fever/Pages/Introduction.aspx">hay fever</a> by staying indoors and avoiding grassy areas when the pollen count is high </li>
			<li>dust mite allergies by using allergy-proof duvets and pillows, and fitting wooden floors rather than carpets </li>

			<h2 id="immunotherapy-desensitisation">Immunotherapy (desensitisation) </h2>

			<p>Immunotherapy may be an option for a small number of people with certain severe and persistent allergies who are unable to control their symptoms using the measures above.</p>

			<p>The treatment involves being given occasional small doses of the allergen – either as an injection, or as drops or tablets under the tongue – over the course of several years.</p>

			<div class="nhsuk-c-keypoint-v2">
				<p>The injection can only be performed in a specialist clinic under the supervision of a doctor, as there is a small risk of a severe reaction. The drops or tablets can usually be taken at home.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The aim of treatment is to help your body get used to the allergen so it doesn't react to it so severely. This won't necessarily cure your allergy, but it will make it milder and mean you can take less medication.</p>

			<h2 id="treating-severe-allergic-reactions-anaphylaxis">Treating severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)</h2>

			<p>Some people with severe allergies may experience life-threatening reactions, known as <a href="/conditions/Anaphylaxis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">anaphylaxis</a> or anaphylactic shock.</p>

			<p>If you're at risk of this, you'll be given special injectors containing a medicine called adrenaline to use in an emergency.</p>

			<div class="nhsuk-c-panel nhsuk-c-panel__with-header-tab nhsuk-c-panel__warning">
				<h3>Important</h3>
				<p>If you develop symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, you should inject yourself in the outer thigh before seeking emergency medical help. </p>
