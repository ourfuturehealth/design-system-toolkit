<p>AMD affects the middle part of your vision, not the edges (peripheral vision).</p>
<p>You can get it in one eye or both.</p>

  "caption": "If it gets worse, you might struggle to see anything in the middle of your vision"

<p>AMD can make things like reading, watching TV, driving or recognising faces difficult.</p>
<p>Other symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>seeing straight lines as wavy or crooked</li>
  <li>objects looking smaller than normal</li>
  <li>colours seeming less bright than they used to</li>
  <li>seeing things that aren't there (hallucinations)</li>
</ul>
<p>AMD isn't painful and doesn't affect the appearance of your eyes.</p>

    <p>These aren't symptoms of AMD but can be signs of other eye problems that need to be treated immediately.</p>
