  {{ designExample({

  <h2>When to use this pattern</h2>
  <p>Use this pattern when your research shows users need to know when the whole page was last checked and when it will be checked again.</p>

  <h2>When not to use this pattern</h2>
  <p>Do not use this pattern in transactional services. We have not tested review dates in forms.</p>
  <p>Do not use it when you change something on a page but have not reviewed the whole page.</p>

  <h2>How the pattern works</h2>
  <p>The pattern consists of 2 dates:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>when you last reviewed the page</li>
    <li>when you will review it again</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Put whole page review dates at the bottom of the page. They are not a high priority for users looking for information.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "patterns",
    item: "reassure-users-that-a-page-is-up-to-date",
    type: "page",
    blankpage: true,
    showArguments: false
  }) }}

  <h3>Embedded content, such as videos</h3>
  <p>Review dates for embedded content should sit close to the content they relate to. Include the last reviewed date (usually the production date) and next review date in the component that holds the embedded content. This is in addition to the page review date.</p>
  <p>For example:</p>

  <figure class="ofh-image app-image--border ofh-u-margin-top-2 ofh-u-margin-bottom-7">
    <img class="ofh-image__img app-u-full-width" src="/assets/review-date-pattern-embedded-content.png" alt="Image of video showing exercise trainer doing workout on mat in fitness studio">
    <figcaption class="ofh-image__caption">

  </figure>

  <h3>The review process</h3>
  {{ insetText({
  "HTML": "<p>The following review process is suggested by the NHS design system. It has been slightly modified to make it more relevant to Our Future Health.</p>"
  }) }}
  <p>A page review involves reviewing the whole page to check that it is still accurate and up to date. Whole page reviews should be part of a planned content lifecycle where you create, then update or delete outdated content.</p>
  <p>Depending on the content, this may involve checking it with a subject matter expert. It also involves, for example, considering any user feedback and checking for broken links or accessibility issues.</p>

  <h2>Research</h3>
  <p>We are using this pattern on our <a href="https://research.ourfuturehealth.org.uk">researcher website</a>. In this context, it's important for researchers to understand when the information was last updated.</p>

  <h3>The NHS Design System team testing review dates on a health information page in summer 2018.</h3>
  <p>At first they tested them away from the main content, closer to the footer of the page, separated by a rule, but users didn't notice them there. So they removed the rule and brought the dates closer to the content. Users then read them and said that they were helpful.</p>
  <p>NHS has not tested review dates in transactional services and do not recommend using them. If you use a review date in a transactional service, please test it with users and let the NHS know what you find.</p>

  <h3>Letting users know about content updates</h3>
  <p>Some teams find their users want to know if information has changed since the page was last reviewed or when there is an important update.</p>
  <p>People who use the service manual and design system, for example, find it helpful to know when information on a page was last updated. We’re using an experimental "Updated" pattern on service manual pages to let users know when we’ve updated something on a page.</p>
  <p>Please share any findings you have about <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/issues/310">telling users about content updates on GitHub</a>. We’ll share our research findings there.</p>
