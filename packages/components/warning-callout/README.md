### Nunjucks macro

If youâ€™re using Nunjucks macros in production be aware that using `html` arguments, or ones ending with `html` can be a [security risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). More about it in the [Nunjucks documentation](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html#user-defined-templates-warning).

```html
{% from 'components/warning-callout/macro.njk' import warningCallout %}

{{ warningCallout({
  "heading": "Important",
  "HTML": "<p>If you develop symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, you should inject yourself in the outer thigh before seeking emergency medical help.</p>"
}) }}
```
