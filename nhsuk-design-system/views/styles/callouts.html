<h2 id="callout_warning">Warning</h2>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<div class="nhsuk-reading-width">
	<p>The warning callout can be used to display information that is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>time critical</li>
        <li>may have a significant health impact</li>
        <li>addresses a common and/or significant misconception or patient mistake</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User need</h3>
	<p>As a user I need to identify and understand the important content on the page (even if I don't read all the content) so that I get the best outcome for my situation and don't endanger my health.</p>
	<h3>Design iterations</h3>

			<h4 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Version 2</h4>
			<h5>Hypothesis</h5>
			<p>We believe that by making the yellow brighter and increasing the font weight, will make it look more like a warning and people will stop and read it.</p>

						<h5>Findings</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>3/5 five users initially missed the callout, with one indicating their attention was drawn to the heading below.</li>

			<h5>Hypothesis</h5>
			<p>We believe that users scan headings. Adding a heading will make users stop and take notice of the callout. Also, changing the background colour to yellow will make it stand out from the surrounding white boxes.</p>
