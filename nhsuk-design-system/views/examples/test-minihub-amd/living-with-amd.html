						<h2>Help with low vision</h2>

						<p>Speak to your eye specialist about a referral to a low-vision clinic if you're having difficulty with daily activities.</p>
						
						<p>Staff at the clinic can give useful advice and practical support. For example, they can talk to you about:</p>
						
						<ul>
						<li>useful devices – such as magnifying lenses</li>
						<li>changes you can make to your home – such as brighter lighting</li>
						<li>software and mobile apps that can make computers and phones easier to use</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>If you have poor vision in both eyes, your specialist may refer you for a type of training called eccentric viewing training. </p>
						
						<p>This involves learning techniques that help make the most of your remaining vision.</p>
						
						<p>Read more about <a href="/conditions/vision-loss/">help and support if you have low vision</a>.</p>
						
						<h2>Staying healthy</h2>
						
						<p>AMD is often linked to an unhealthy lifestyle. If you have it, try to:</p>
						
						<ul>
						<li>eat a <a href="/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Healthyeating.aspx">balanced diet</a></li>
						<li><a href="/livewell/fitness/Pages/Fitnesshome.aspx">exercise regularly</a></li>
						<li><a href="/livewell/loseweight/Pages/Loseweighthome.aspx">lose weight</a> if you're overweight</li>
						<li><a href="/livewell/smoking/Pages/stopsmokingnewhome.aspx">stop smoking</a> if you smoke</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>There's some evidence to suggest that certain health supplements might help stop AMD getting worse, but this isn't definitive.</p>
						
						<div class="nhsuk-c-panel nhsuk-c-panel__with-header-tab nhsuk-c-panel__warning">
							<h3>Important</h3>
							<p>Speak to your GP or specialist if you're considering taking supplements for AMD. They're not suitable for everyone.</p>
						</div>

						<p>The Macular Society has more on <a href="https://www.macularsociety.org/diet-and-exercise" title="External website">diet and nutrition for AMD</a>.</p>

						<h2>Driving</h2>
						
						<p>AMD can make it unsafe for you to drive. Ask your specialist if they think you should stop driving.</p>
						
						<p>You're required by law to tell DVLA about your condition if:</p>
						
						<ul>
						<li>it affects both eyes</li>
						<li>it only affects one eye but your remaining vision is below the minimum <a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-eyesight-rules" title="External website">standards of vision for driving</a></li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-driving-medical-condition" title="External website">how to tell DVLA about a medical condition</a>.</p>

						<h2>Monitoring and check-ups</h2>
						
						<p>You'll have regular check-ups with a specialist to monitor your condition.</p>
						
						<p>Contact your specialist as soon as possible if your vision gets worse or you notice any new symptoms.</p>
						
						<div class="nhsuk-c-keypoint">
							<p>Keep having routine eye tests (usually every 2 years). They can pick up other eye problems that your check-ups don't look for.</p>
						</div>

						<h2>Registering as sight impaired</h2>
						
						<p>If your vision continues to get worse, you may want to consider registering your sight loss.</p>
						
						<p>This can make it easier to claim financial benefits, such as help with health costs.</p>
						
						<p>Your specialist can check your vision and complete an official certificate if you meet the requirements to be registered.</p>

						<h2>Getting more help and support</h2>
						
						<p>Living with AMD can be very difficult.</p>
						
						<p>In addition to support from your specialist, you may find it useful to use support groups such as:</p>
						
						<ul>
						<li>the <a href="https://www.macularsociety.org/" title="External website">Macular Society</a> – which has a range of <a href="https://www.macularsociety.org/support-services" title="External website">support services</a> and a helpline on 0300 3030 111</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/" title="External website">RNIB</a> – which has <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/practical-help" title="External website">practical advice about living with sight loss</a> and a helpline on 0303 123 9999</li>
						</ul>
						
						<div class="nhsuk-c-panel nhsuk-c-panel__with-header-tab nhsuk-c-panel__warning">
							<h3>Important</h3>
							<p>See a GP if you've been feeling low for more than 2 weeks. They can offer support and treatment if you need it.</p>
