# Our Future Health design system toolkit

> **Note** <br>
> This toolkit is based on the [NHS.UK frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend), forked as of early 2022, and has been adapted for Our Future Health needs (which includes a rename of the prefix for all CSS classes to `ofh-`).
>
> We are indebted to the original work carried out by NHS Digital and GDS.

Our Future Health design system toolkit contains the code you need to start building user interfaces for Our Future Health websites and services.

## How to make a new release

1. Create a new branch for the release, off the latest `main` branch, and name it `release-v{version_number}`.
1. Update the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and ensure it reflects everything that is being released in the new version.
    - This mainly involves converting the "Unreleased" section (at the top) to a new version section (remember to add a date) and adding a new "Unreleased" section for the next version.
    - The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
1. Update the `version` field in [package.json](package.json) and run `npm install` (to update the `package-lock.json`).
1. Submit a new pull request (PR) for the branch (with your changes) and get it reviewed.
    - Note that this PR should only contain changes to the `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. Any actual code/feature changes should first be done in a separate PR, before the release PR.
1. Immediately after the PR is merged, update your local clone, then create and push a Git tag for the release.
    - E.g. `git tag -a v2.0.0-alpha.0 -m "v2.0.0-alpha.0" && git push origin --tags`.
    - Note the `v` prefix is important as the release workflow will only trigger on tags that are prefixed with this.
1. When the tag is pushed, the release workflow will trigger. Part of this workflow involves creating a named release in the GitHub repo ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)). Once this has been created, edit it via the GitHub UI and copy/paste the matching Changelog entries.
